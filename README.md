Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Once data is scraped, it can be cleaned and structured to improve its usability. Some cleaning techniques may involve:

## Removing duplicates
Handling missing values
Standardizing text fields (e.g., converting titles to title case)
Extracting key details (e.g., pulling out genres from descriptions)
Normalizing formats (e.g., converting dates to a consistent format)
Depending on the complexity, these steps can be performed within justwatch_scraper.py or in a separate preprocessing script.

## Acknowledgments
